            <h2>Before Joining the Foundation</h2>
            <p>Merrick travolta was born in a small city in the UK, He soon moved to Canada and eventually with some trial and error, Found himself on the police force. Though he had a habit of finding some more.. Occult and supernatural cases. His last cases before being picked up by the foundation involved looking into a murder which had no explanation. The foundation would soon take over the case, as the murder itself was an SCP-1155 instance, However one of the lead researchers found a lot of useful details with the matter within Travolta’s report, this lead to him getting recruited by the foundation.</p>

            <h2>Iota-10</h2>
            <p>His initial time in the foundation was first spent using his position within the police force as a member of Iota-10, Here he would develop all the skills he would need to blend in, Investigate and report any anomalies or concerning GOI movements that he detected. He would hold this position for 2 years. During this time he would befriend a few people beneficial to his later career. Namely Edward 'Sirenfal' Song, Aiden 'Trench' Sato, His last mission he located and recovered SCP-████ before deciding he needed to change the scene and move onto a new position, Taking a position as an internal Affairs agent of site-65.
</p>

            <h2>Joining Site 65</h2>
            <p>With training from the Ambassador Andy Patterson, He learned how to do the job of an agent. And soon he was one of the sites more nocturnal agents, Handling the late night issues and talking to the other late shift staff, Befriending a few of them. He would assist in work on a few operations and even documentation of one or two. But soon he would see fit to reach for a higher position moving up to Ambassador of Internal Affairs.
</p>
            <h2>Ambassador Merrick </h2>
            <p>Merrick would soon reach this position during the last few weeks before the end of the directorship of John Deer and Tim Drake. The former leaving the site for better opportunities, The latter soon making his move up to Site administration. Here he would lead a few cases. Work on several others. Proposing some changes to internal affairs. Gaining a good working relationship with his colleagues, John, Mike and Liam. However it would be during Phill Dee's directorship that he would grow confident enough to push up to the position of Director, while falling short the first time he would make another attempt just as Phill Dee resigned and soon that position was his. </p>

            <h2>Director Merrick</h2>
            <p>Merrick would make director on his second interview, Much to the agreement of his colleagues now subordinates. He would stay in this position for quite some time. Assisting many people in not only joining internal affairs, Rising to Ambassador. But also leaving and moving to better things.  During such he would claim to a system of bail, Similar to that of the citation system and also a project that would see anomalies used beyond there storage inside the facility, Though the results of that have yet to bare any fruit.
</p>
            <h2>Director of Doubt</h2>
            <p>After a bit of time, Merrick began to see issues within himself, attributing it to Broda being a better director he began to see himself as worthless to his department. Soon he would find himself always wanting to sit alone, be on his own, he also began treating his life as secondary to his duty and just.. In general reckless abandon. During this time he would start writing some notes to himself, However unfortunate for him (or fortunate depending on who you ask), A tech expert found and turned that document into Director of Medicine Kayla, Who after handing it off to Omega-1, Had Merrick attend a psych eval. The evaluation done and Kayla writing her verdict. Letting Travolta know he can always talk to her, Reaffirming that with a chat with Cece and her later on, This brings Travolta some comfort to know he’s not doing.. The worst he could.
</p>
            <h2>Joining the Council</h2>
            <p>While the Council was not his first choice of place to go. He soon began to see their... merit in the site, He began to work and soon found an ominous black envelope placed on his desk when he returned from a break. Reading it he found him summoned to floor 3 to which he attended, This would be one of the most stressful interviews of his life, The pay off too great to want to give it up without a fight knowing the council were just itching to remove him after a standoff with one of their assistants. 
            Self doubt eating at him he soon found his verdict. He had risen to the ranks. Ascending to the seat of O5-2. Codename: The Lawbreaker. A relfection on his past within internal affairs.</p>
